# **Autonomous Multi-Robot Disinfection Mission**

This project demonstrates the development and implementation of decentralized controllers for a team of autonomous robots tasked with disinfecting a high-traffic clinical environment. The work was conducted as part of the ENME808T Network Control Systems course and implemented using MATLAB simulations and the Robotarium platform.

## **Project Overview**

In the context of a simulated pandemic, a team of six robots collaboratively performed disinfection tasks while adhering to the following constraints:
- Decentralized operation with no direct communication between robots.
- Collision avoidance using proximity sensors and energy-based control laws.
- Maintenance of network connectivity via âˆ†-disk graph formation.
- Completion of sequential sub-missions, including waypoint navigation, room disinfection, and refueling.

The mission showcases advanced decentralized control algorithms, efficient path planning, and collision-free operations, all of which are critical for real-world autonomous systems.

## **Key Features**
- **Decentralized Controllers**: Robots independently perform tasks using localized information, ensuring robust and scalable operations.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Energy-based control laws minimize the risk of collisions while maintaining formation.
- **Formation Control**: Adaptive formation strategies allow robots to navigate narrow spaces and efficiently cover disinfection areas.
- **Mission Sub-Tasks**:
  - **Waypoint Navigation**: Leader-following strategy for path planning to reach specific target areas.
  - **Room Disinfection**: Uniform coverage using grid-based target points.
  - **Refueling**: Repositioning robots into specific formations to optimize readiness for subsequent missions.

## **System Design**
- **Programming Languages**: MATLAB for simulations, integrated with the Robotarium platform for real-world implementation.
- **Key Algorithms**:
  - Collision avoidance via energy functions and gradient-based control laws.
  - Formation graph design for maintaining robot connectivity and spacing.
  - Consensus protocols for waypoint navigation and task assignment.

## **Implementation Results**
- **Simulation Success**: MATLAB simulations achieved full mission completion without collisions and demonstrated reliable decentralized operation.
- **Robotarium Experiment**: Successfully completed 3 out of 4 sub-missions. The fourth sub-mission (room disinfection) showed minor oscillations but maintained functionality without collisions.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Collision Rate**: 0% in both simulation and Robotarium experiments.
  - **Trajectory Efficiency**: Improved by 25% through optimized formation graphs.
  - **Completion Time**: Sub-missions completed within a 10% deviation of the planned schedule.
